# Vacations4You Web Restful API Project

## Overview
Vacations4You is a new venture initiated by a large Travel Company based in the USA, aimed at providing Cruise bookings, Activities, and holiday packages to clients in Sri Lanka. The web-based solution is designed for use by Travel Agents representing Vacations4You, making reservations on behalf of their clients through outlets in Kandy City Center and Colombo City Center or via their Call Centre.

### User Groups
- **Travel Agent**: Search, book products, and obtain payments.
- **Backoffice Staff**: Ensure searchable products are available in the system.
- **Admin**: Manage Travel Agent accounts, including adding new agents and resetting passwords.

### Main Categories for Bookings
1. **Cruise Reservations**
2. **Activity Reservations**
3. **Holiday Packages (Flight + Hotel Reservations)**

## Project Components
- **Front-end Web Application**: Interface for Travel Agents and Backoffice staff.
- **Backend API**: Developed using Node Express to be consumed by the front-end web application.
- **Database**: MongoDB to store all relevant data.

## Section 1: Aims and Summary of API Functionality
The API is central to the application, enabling all functionalities through RESTful services, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. It emphasizes server-side validation and admin routes for backoffice functionality.

## Section 2: Aims and Summary of Client Web Application Functionality
The front end is expected to be built using ReactJS, with justifications for using other frameworks if chosen. Creativity and user experience are key, with bonus points for integrating 3rd party APIs like Google Maps or Google Places.

## Section 3: Technical Specifications
- **NPM Packages**: Use of relevant NPM packages for domain-specific functionalities.
- **Middleware**: Implementation of middleware for logging and API authentication.
- **Authentication**: Mechanism for user authentication, separate from the 3rd party API integrations.
- **API Documentation**: Essential for understanding API functionalities and endpoints.

## Section 4: Report Guidelines
Each team member must submit a report detailing their contributions, technical approaches, code snippets, screenshots, challenges faced, and solutions. The report should also include a link to the GitHub project.

### Report Structure
- **Cover Page**: Project details and team information.
- **Introduction**: Team members and task allocations.
- **Technical Discussion**: Development processes, functionalities implemented, and technical challenges.
- **Appendix**: Full code contributions.
- **GitHub Project Link**: Must be included in all individual reports.

## Contribution Guidelines
Contributors are expected to follow the outlined project components and report guidelines, ensuring their code and documentation align with the project's aims and technical specifications.
